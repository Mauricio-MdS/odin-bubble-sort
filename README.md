# odin-bubble-sort

[Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) exercise proposed in [The Odin Project's Ruby course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort).

## Assignment

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

```Ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```
